## Two Pointers

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/">LC 0125</a>

Valid Palindrome

- Difficulty: **very easy**
- But still.. Use this hint: isalnum()

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/">LC 0015</a>

Sum of Three Values

- Difficulty: **medium** (kinda hard for me)
- Very nice problem..
- sorting will make life easie
- Use one loop that keep tracks of first valu
- ** skip if the value is the same as the previous on
- Use two pointers to find the other two value
- <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/comments/1812137">Nice explaination</a>


<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/">LC 0019</a> 

Remove nth Node from End of List
- Difficulty: **medium**
- Not tried yet (8/24/23)


<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/">LC 0075</a> 

Sort Colors

- Difficulty: **medium**

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/">LC 0151</a>

Reverse Words in a String
- Difficulty: **medium**
- Seems easy to me (8/24/23 lol)

  
<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/">LC 0680</a> 

Valid Palindrome II

- Difficulty: **easy**
- Interesting approach: Two Pointers from begin() and end() of list
- just check if the rest of the string is palindrome or not if chars don't match and return true/false
- No counter needed to keep track of that one odd char
